# Tetris

### Project Description

Inspired by the classic game, this recreation of Tetris tested object-oriented design skills using Java. Utilizing various libraries, this game includes sounds for different aspects of the game and stays true to the ruleset and scoring of the original game. The sound files come from a public resource website, specifically from the version Tetris 99 on the Nintendo Switch.

### Tools and Languages Used

This project was coded entirely using Java. I coded it mostly in Visual Studio Code, however I had to switch to Eclipse to establish a resource folder.
